# Simplistic JSON To-Do List

This project is a simplistic To-Do list exercise. Functionality took appoximately around an 
hour to complete. The project uses React.js on the client side, Node.js and Express.js 
in the back-end, and uses a JSON file as a make-shift database.


## Installation and Demo

Extract the zip file into a folder you want the project in.

Using 2 Terminals, open the "client" folder and "server" folder respectively. I use VSCode, so 
I just split a terminal, one for the client and one for the server.

Install their dependencies with "npm i" or "npm install". This will take some time depending 
your computer and internet.

After installing the dependencies go to the terminal for the server and type in "node server.js"
to start the server.

After starting the server, start the client side by typing "npm start"

This should have the app up and functioning.
